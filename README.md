Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C
This program is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C where a human player competes against the computer. The game is played on a 3x3 board, with the human player using the symbol 'X' and the computer using 'O'. The game includes the following features:

Game Loop: The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full (resulting in a tie).
Player Input: The player can input their move by selecting a row and column (1-3).
Computer AI: The computer randomly selects an available spot for its move.
Winner Check: The game checks for a winner after each move, and declares either a win, loss, or tie at the end.
Replay Option: After each game, the player can choose to play again or exit.
The game logic includes input validation, random move generation for the computer, and checks for rows, columns, and diagonals to determine the winner.
